* LANs
- The connect nearby devices
* WANs
- The connect devices that are typycally relative far apart

* Ethernet LANs
- Ethernet switch: proving many physical porits into which cables can be connected
- Erthenet cables: using for connect different Ethernet devices

* Wireless LANs
- AP: using radio wares to send the bits from one node to the next. 

* Ethernet Type (by IEEE)
- Table 2-2

* UTP cables
- Define: The cables use electrical signal to tranmis data
- Structure: the wires will be twisted together
+ Electric circuit: use two wires to create a loop, allowing electricity to flow
+ Encoding scheme signal: change the electrical signal over time, follow the rules to communicate 1s and 0s
+ Twisted: helping cancel out most of the EMI (The EMI is electromagnetic interference that interferes with the electrical signals in nearby wires)
- 10BASW-T and 100BASE-T require two pairs of wires while the 1000BASE-T requires four pairs. Each wire has a color-coded platic coating, with the wires in a pair having color scheme
- RJ-45 connector: having eight physical locations into which the eight wires in the cable can be inserted, called pin positions, or simply pins. These pins create a place where the ends of the copper wires can touch the electronics inside the nodes at the end of the physical link so that electricity can flow.

* 100BASE-T rules
Ethernet NIC, Router, Wireless tranmitters use the pair connected to pins 1 and 2; The NIC receivers use a pair of wires at pin 3 and 6.
Hubs, Switches tranmis on pins 3,6

* 1000BASE-T rules
- Similar 100BASE-T rules but adds a pair pins 4 and 5 and 7 and 8, using more advanced electronics that allow both ands to transmit and receive simultaneously on each wire pair.
* Fiber Cabling
- Cladding and core work together to create the environment to allow tranmission of light over the cable.
* Sending ethernet with switchs and Hubs
- Half-duplex: the devices must wait to send if it currently receiving a freame; in other words, it cannot send and receive at the same time.
- Full-duplex: the device does not have to wait before sending; it can send and receive at the same time
* Lan Hubs
- Like switch, but hubs use different rules for forwarding data, hubs forward data using physical layer standard rather data-link standard -> layer 1 devices. 
- Mechanism: When an electrical signal comes in one hub port, the hub repeats that signal out all orther ports. 
- Downside: When two or more tranmitted a signal at the same time instant, it occurs collision. It can garbled the data. Use half-duplex and CSMA/CD to prevent the collison in Hubs. 

* WAN
WAN: have two technologies
* Leased-line WAN
- HDLC (High-level Data Link Control):
